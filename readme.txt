- This is used as documentation for the design of bioinspired project/models.
- High level relevant information will be disclose here.
- The documentation will consist of jupiter files where I will use markdown for documentation and python for data analysis and design porpuses.
    - Large source files! All the heavy files will be saved in my local machine videos, PDF, etc.
    - Images. For images Jupyter does not let you pull them from different directories which sucks. To this end I like nice formation the two options I consider are:
        - Using a external server and save images as html with url address. In this case, https://postimages.org/ provides 32 Mb free storage.
        - GitHub provides with 2 Gb. My images are ~ 0.2 Mb per image. This is 10k images while using postimage it would be 160 images. The decission is clear. I am sorry but images will be going to github, sorry it nerds.
            - I will code a python script to see how much I can shrink the img files.
